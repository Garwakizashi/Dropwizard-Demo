# Dropwizard-Demo
Demo using Dropwizard (Java)

This is a quick mock up of creating an API service using Dropwizard framework. 

Examples include usage of Data Access Objects (Dao) and also a bit more direct MySQL interaction at code level.

The database used in this demo is the sample employee database from MySQL (https://dev.mysql.com/doc/employee/en/). 
This demo is assuming the schema is imported to a local instance of MySQL, and a user 'test_user' with password 'password123' is 
available with SELECT (as of right now) permissions.

IDE used: IntelliJ Community Edition
Dependencies: Maven, Java
